    <h1 align="center">To You, From Your Favorite Monkey</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="outlined">I know that you might not know me as long as some other people you know but you've made the last two months of my life feel like paradise. 
        In my eyes you are stunning, not only your beautiful eyes, but your angelic voice, your infectious laugh, you calling me even when you are busy, and for the first time someone liked my jealousy. 
        I could go on forever about how much you mean to me but I don't want this to be lengthy. I feel like I still don't know everything about you so I want you to stay with me, show me the side that you show no one to, and I'll do the same. 
        I wanna explore the world together, and experience the things you want to do and the things I want to do. I want to grow with you, change with you, learn with you, face my fears with you, and love with you. 
        I love you so much that my dumbass spent a week trying to learn this coding language so I can make this for you. As long as you stay with me I will stay too, as long you are there I will always be there for you. Kayla, I'm in love with you.</p>
